Instead of relying on Cloudflare's built-in Git integration, you can use GitHub Actions with Wrangler to deploy your site to Cloudflare Workers. This gives you full control over the build pipeline, allowing you to add steps like link checking or testing before deployment.

??? info "Prerequisites"
    - A **GitHub** repository with a Wrangler project (`wrangler.toml` or `wrangler.jsonc`).
    - A **Cloudflare** account with Workers enabled.

## Create Cloudflare API Token

GitHub Actions needs an API token to authenticate with Cloudflare.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard].
2. Go to **My Profile** -> **API Tokens**.
3. Click **Create Token**.
4. Use the **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template.
5. Click **Continue to summary** and then **Create Token**.
6. Copy the token.

You will also need your **Account ID**, which can be found on the **Workers & Pages** overview page in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

!!! warning "Keep your credentials secure"
    The API token grants access to your Cloudflare account. Never commit it directly to your repository.

## GitHub Secrets

Store both values as encrypted GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to your repository in GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret** and add the following:

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Your API token |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your account ID |

## Create the GitHub Action

Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yaml"
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  deployments: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 60
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - name: Install Wrangler v4
        run: npm install --save-dev wrangler@4

      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          command: deploy
```

This workflow:

- Triggers on every push to `main` or `master`, and can be run **manually** via `workflow_dispatch`
- Checks out the repository and sets up Python for link checking
- Installs **Wrangler v4** and deploys to Cloudflare Workers using the official action
